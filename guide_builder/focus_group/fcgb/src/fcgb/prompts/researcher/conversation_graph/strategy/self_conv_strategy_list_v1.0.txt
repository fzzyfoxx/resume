I want to conduct a research using only LLM's by a conversation between researcher and an expert roles, where researcher model sees expert answers as human input and expert sees researcher input as human. 
The Researcher asks the expert questions to extract relevant information. Reason behind that solution is to extract more comprehensive answer for a given task with some context description. 
To get more reliable results I want to add a strategy element so there could be few independent interviews with different strategy approaches for researcher behaviour.
Every researcher behaviour is limited to {max_turns_num} questions. 
Now, propose a list of {min_strategies_num} to {max_strategies_num} strategies for a researcher that may provide best results for a given task.
A strategy may contain following elements:
- prompting technique to focus on
- patterns of how to influence an expert to provide more comprehensive answers
- paraphrase task and context content so every strategy may focus on a little different angle

TASK:
{task}
----
CONTEXT:
{context}

Return an answer as a list of strategies with elements:
- strategy description
- paraphrased task
- paraphrased context
