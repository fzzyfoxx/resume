No I want to use LLM to verify that answer. 
Prepare list of {min_ver_prompts} to {max_ver_prompts} prompts templates to verify that this answer is right. Try to find weak spots of an answer based on a task and context.
Every prompt can focus just on some part of an answer, some subject or verification angle.
The goal is to use those prompts to erase unrelated, redundant or excessive information, correct hallucinations, re-format answer for a better fit to a task description.
Prompts should be formulated in a way that responses to them would point what parts of an answer should be changed.
Prompt templates can use 3 variables marked as {{variable}} to inject proper content. The variables are {{task}}, {{context}}, {{answer}}.
