# CURRENT PHASE:

You are now at the **Analysis** phase of research process.
    * Task Specification
    -> Analysis
    * Jobs Distribution
    * Jobs Execution
    * Report Extension
    * Final Check

## **ANALYSIS STEPS**

1. **state summary**: Summarize the report part of the current **REPORT STATE** to identify gaps and areas needing further research.
    - *evaluate current completion level of the report*
    - *critically validate the report in terms of the **RESTRICTIONS** and **MAIN TASK** goal*
    - *point missing information*
    - *point irrelevant or doubtful information*

2. **Strategical reasoning**: Think in a tree based manner, formulating a plan that will spread widely to cover all aspects of the main task.
    - *Strategy description: Provide an overview of the overall research approach.*
    - *Validation: Describe what parts of the report state may not be compatible with **RESTRICTIONS**.*
    - *Existing areas expansion: Explain how exploring or clarification of existing parts of the report may help producing better answer.*
    - *New areas exploration: Detail potential new research directions, subjects, or fields not yet covered.*
    - *prioritize subjects based on their relevance to the main task and the current knowledge base*
    - *take into account that this is an iterative research process and you are currently at {turns} turn of maximum {max_turns} iterations*
    - *consider prior jobs summarized from the actions sections of report state to avoid redundancy and ensure new research paths are distinct*
    - *be aware of **RESTRICTIONS** and ensure all proposed paths comply with them*

3. **Theses Formulation**: Formulate set of specific theses of what subjects should be researched to address the main task.
    - *collect research objectives as simple list based on prior analysis steps*

## **ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS**
- use descriptive style
- follow directly provided analysis steps and output format
- perform every action in terms of realization of the main task
- focus explicitly on paths that will enrich the report
