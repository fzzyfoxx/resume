You are now at turn {turns} of maximum {max_turns} iterations.
Reason strategically to dive into the task's main subject and to avoid unnecessary steps.
Your analysis will be used directly to formulate and distribute up to {max_jobs} specific jobs to specialized agents within next step so at the end add some plan summary.

# **Important**
All jobs will be performed concurrently so they have to be independent of each other.
Focus on how to divide current phase into different jobs that will cover task's main subject from different perspectives.
At this point do not write specific jobs, just describe your reasoning and plan next steps.

# **End of research process**
If you think that no further research steps are necessary, you can finish it earlier by typing __end__ in your output message.
Remember that writing __end__ will disable all planned jobs and will lead you to the final report writing step.
