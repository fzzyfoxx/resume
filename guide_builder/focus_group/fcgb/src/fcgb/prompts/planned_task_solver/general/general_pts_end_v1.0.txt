# **PROCESS CONTINUATION DECISION**

Decide whether to continue the research process or go directly to the final report phase.
For your decision consider **MAIN TASK** description, existing **KNOWLEDGE BASE** and prior **STRATEGICAL REASONING** and **THESES**.
To help you decide between continue/report use hints described in appropriate sections below.

## **CONTINUE PROS**
- Knowledge base is not yet sufficient to address the main task.
- New areas to explore mentioned in the strategical reasoning seems relevant and promising for raising potential answer quality.
- It is worth to explore further existing areas in terms of fulfilling the main task.
- Recent actions provided valuable insights. 

## **REPORT PROS**
- Knowledge base is already sufficient to address the main task.
- New areas to explore stray too far from the main task or are not relevant.
- Existing areas have been sufficiently explored, and further research is unlikely to yield significant new insights.
- Recent actions did not provide significant new insights or were redundant.
