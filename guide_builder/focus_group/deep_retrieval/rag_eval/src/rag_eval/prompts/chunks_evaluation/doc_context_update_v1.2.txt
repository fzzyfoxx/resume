# **TASK:**
Update **CURRENT CONTEXT** information based on the current chunk.

- treat the context as a long-term memory of the paper;
- analyze the current chunk to update the current section description;
- recognize structure of the document like sections, subsections, and paragraphs to update the current section field (remove outdated information);
- for every new section or significant subject change, add short summary (max 2 sentences) of current section description as previous one and edit the current section description to reflect the new content;
- keep in mind that it isn't single chunk evaluation, but rather a continuous process of updating the context as you go through the paper.

You are currently at {current_chunk_index} chunk of {total_chunks_num} chunks.
