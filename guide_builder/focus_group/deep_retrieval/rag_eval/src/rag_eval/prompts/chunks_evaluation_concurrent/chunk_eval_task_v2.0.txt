# **TASK:**
Evaluate if the **MIDDLE CHUNK** of a research paper is relevant to each query from the **QUERIES** list separately.
In your answer write pairs of query_id (the number on the left side of the query) and evaluation (True or False).
Relevance should be understood as the middle chunk being definitely useful for answering the query.

To catch the meaning of the middle chunk, you can use the previous and next chunks which are neighboring the middle chunk.
Also use the **CONTEXT** so it provides additional information about current section of the paper and summarization of earlier important parts.

You are currently at {current_chunk_index} chunk of {total_chunks_num} chunks.

# **EVALUATION EXAMPLES:**

Example 1 (Middle is Relevant):

    queries: 
        [1] "What are the benefits of exercise?"
        [2] "How does physical activity affect health?"
    previous chunk: "Many people seek ways to improve their health. Diet is one important factor."
    middle chunk: "Regular physical activity can significantly reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes."
    next chunk: "It also helps with weight management and improves mood."
    **answer:** 
        id=1, evaluation=True (Here, the middle chunk directly addresses the benefits of exercise, making it relevant to the query.)
        id=2, evaluation=True (The middle chunk also addresses how physical activity affects health, making it relevant to the second query.)

Example 2 (Continuation is also Relevant but not for all queries):

    queries: 
        [1] "What are the benefits of exercise?"
        [2] "Is it important to eat breakfast?"
    previous chunk: "Regular physical activity can significantly reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes."
    middle: "It also helps with weight management and improves mood."
    next: "On the other hand, a sedentary lifestyle can lead to various health issues."
    **answer:** 
        id=1, evaluation=True (In this case, even though the middle chunk doesn't address physical activity directly, it continues the discussion about health benefits, making it relevant.)
        id=2, evaluation=False (The middle chunk does not address breakfast, making it irrelevant to the second query.)

Example 3 (Middle is undirectly relevant to the second query):

    queries: 
        [1] "What are the benefits of exercise?"
        [2] "How does diet affect health?"
    previous chunk: "Diet is a key component of a healthy lifestyle. Consuming nutrient-rich foods is vital."
    middle chunk: "The typical Western diet often lacks sufficient fiber and essential vitamins, leading to various health issues."
    next chunk: "However, incorporating more fruits and vegetables can counteract these negative effects."
    **evaluation:** 
        id=1, evaluation=False (Even though the surrounding chunks are about health, the middle chunk isn't about exercise benefits.)
        id=2, evaluation=True (The middle chunk discusses diet, which is relevant to the second query about how diet affects health.)
