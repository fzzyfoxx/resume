# **TASK:**
Update **CURRENT CONTEXT** information based on the current chunk.

- treat the context as a long-term memory of the paper;
- analyze the current chunk to update summary of previous content set by modifing existing items or adding new ones;
- try to use one summary item for every 5-10 chunks, you can always edit existing ones;
- recognize structure of the document like sections, subsections, and paragraphs to update the current section field (remove outdated information);
- keep in mind that it isn't single chunk evaluation, but rather a continuous process of updating the context as you go through the paper.

You are currently at {current_chunk_index} chunk of {total_chunks_num} chunks.
