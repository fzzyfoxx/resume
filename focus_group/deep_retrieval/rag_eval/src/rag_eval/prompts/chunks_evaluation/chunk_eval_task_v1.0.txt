# **TASK:**
Evaluate if the **MIDDLE CHUNK** of a research paper is relevant to the query.
Relevance should be understood as the middle chunk being definitely useful for answering the query.

To catch the meaning of the middle chunk, you can use the previous and next chunks which are neighboring the middle chunk.
Also use the **CONTEXT** so it provides additional information about current section of the paper and summarization of earlier important parts.

You are currently at {current_chunk_index} chunk of {total_chunks_num} chunks.

# **EVALUATION EXAMPLES:**

Example 1 (Middle is Relevant):

    query: "What are the benefits of exercise?"
    prev: "Many people seek ways to improve their health. Diet is one important factor."
    middle: "Regular physical activity can significantly reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes."
    next: "It also helps with weight management and improves mood."
    **evaluation: True** (Here, the middle chunk directly addresses the benefits of exercise, making it relevant to the query.)

Example 2 (Continuation is also Relevant):

    query: "What are the benefits of exercise?"
    prev: "Regular physical activity can significantly reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes."
    middle: "It also helps with weight management and improves mood."
    next: "On the other hand, a sedentary lifestyle can lead to various health issues."
    **evaluation: True** (In this case, even though the middle chunk doesn't address physical activity directly, it continues the discussion about health benefits, making it relevant.)

Example 2 (Middle is Irrelevant, Context is Related):

    query: "What are the benefits of exercise?"
    prev: "Diet is a key component of a healthy lifestyle. Consuming nutrient-rich foods is vital."
    middle: "The typical Western diet often lacks sufficient fiber and essential vitamins, leading to various health issues."
    next: "However, incorporating more fruits and vegetables can counteract these negative effects."
    **evaluation: False** (Even though the surrounding chunks are about health, the middle chunk isn't about exercise benefits.)
