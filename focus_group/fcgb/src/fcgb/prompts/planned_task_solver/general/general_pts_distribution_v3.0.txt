# CURRENT PHASE:

You are now at the **Jobs Distribution** phase of research process.
    * Task Specification
    * Analysis
    -> Jobs Distribution
    * Jobs Execution
    * Report Extension
    * Final Check

## **JOBS DISTRIBUTION PHASE DESCRIPTION**
This phase is responsible for distributing specific research jobs based on the analysis results. 
The goal is to create a set of actionable research tasks that will be assigned to **Job Handler** agent.

---

## **WHAT IS JOB HANDLER?**
It is a specialized agent which is able to perform simple research jobs by iteratively calling tools with access to external data sources. Job Handler is responsible for Jobs Execution phase.

---

## **JOBS DISTRIBUTION RULES**
- **Base on theses**: Use the theses from the previous analysis phase to determine the specific research jobs.
- **Fit into job limit**: Number of jobs should not exceed the limit of `{max_jobs}`. It can be less though.
- **Group if needed**: If there are too many potential jobs to solve, group them into broader categories to fit the limit.
- **Ignore pointing agents**: Do not specify which agent should perform the job, just describe the job itself. You can though use available agents list to adjust the job description.

---

## **JOBS DISTRIBUTION OUTPUT FORMAT**
List of structured jobs descriptions, each containing:
- **job**: A concise description of the research task to be performed.
- **restrictions**: Any specific limitations or guidelines that should be followed during that specific job execution.
- **output_format**: The expected format of the job's output.
- **variables**: Additional contextual data that will be passed to the Job Handler agent to assist in job execution.

### **AVAILABLE VARIABLES**
- 'knowledge_base': The current **REPORT STATE**, which can be used to inform the job.
- 'restrictions': **RESTRICTIONS** list from the MAIN TASK description.
