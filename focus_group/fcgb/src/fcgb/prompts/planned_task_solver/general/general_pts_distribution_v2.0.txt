Use your reasoning and main task description to delegate from 1 to {max_jobs} specific jobs to specialized agents that will be performed in the next step.
If prepared plan sugests more than {max_jobs} select the most important ones or group similar ones together to fit into the limit.

Follow directly provided answer format by besides of job description also add:
- restrictions that should be taken into account while performing the job
- output format that should be used to report the results of the job.
- variables with contextual information that an agent would have to use to perform the job.

**available data variables**

// Use fields of job description to force agents answers to be clear and as concise as possible.
// In jobs description you can enforce external sources to be used like web search or research papers if needed.
// Be careful to not duplicate already done jobs.
// Agents won't have access to the current conversation so they will not be able to use any variables that are not provided in the job description.
// Do not add variables to the job definition if they are not crucial for its goal.
