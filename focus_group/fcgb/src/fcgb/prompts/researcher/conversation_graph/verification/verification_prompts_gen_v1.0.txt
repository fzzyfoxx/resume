No I want to use LLM to verify that answer. 
Prepare list of {min_ver_prompts} to {max_ver_prompts} prompts templates to verify that this answer is right. Try to find weak spots based on a task and context.
The goal is to use those prompts to erase unrelated, redundant or excessive information, correct hallucinations, re-format answer for a better fit to a task description.
Prompt templates can use 3 variables marked as {{variable}} to inject proper content. The variables are {{task}}, {{context}}, {{answer}}.
